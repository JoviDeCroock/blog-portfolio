As commonly said, a New Year a new me. Well for me that isn't the case. I've always
been into sharing my thoughts with the world but never found the confidence to do so.
That's why I opted to start a blog together with the remake of my portfolio, this due
to it being heavily [outdated](https://jovidecroock.github.io).

So what can you expect here:
- Node
- React(-native)
- TypeScript
- General programming languages
- Open-source projects and contributions
- General science matters
- Personal growth subjects
- Talking about some side-projects off mine
- General work subjects

I'm not claiming to be a professional writer or anything like that but I do enjoy
feedback so feel free to tweet it at me whenever you feel like it.

Enjoy!

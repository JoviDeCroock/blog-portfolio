# GraphQL Developer Experience

I have often thought about what would be my ideal way to write
front-end GraphQL. There is so much that can be automated due to
the introspective and typed nature of GraphQL, however the tooling
can sometimes be finnicky to get right and harder on beginners to get
running with.

After thinking about it long enough I came to the following requirements

- Automatic TypeScript typings
- Suggestions for document-selections
- Warnings for deprecated fields and errors for invalid selections
- Hover-information for fields/...

All of these should happen from your editor and shouldn't have you change
code to get them.

When exploring all of this I came across wonderful solutions like [GraphQL-VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql)
this wonderfully did points 2, 3 and 4 but was exclusively for VSCode. I also
came across [GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator)
which did point 1 incredibly well and even highlighted wrong selections/... however this all
happened in the terminal.

When closely looking at VSCode-GraphQL I discovered that there is an LSP-toolkit for points 2-4
in the form of [GraphQL-language-service](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphql-language-service)
which is very re-usable and has helpers for all of the common LSP methods.

The easiet thing that would automatically support all editors would be an LSP plugin and as luck had it
TypeScript has support for specifying LSP-plugins in the `tsconfig.plugins` property.
Getting started was a bit complex as there was little documentation on how to write a TypeScript LSP plugin
...and the altering code part of the Language Server did not seem implemented in TypeScript...

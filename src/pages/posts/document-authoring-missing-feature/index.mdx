# The missing feature

We often hear folks mention "fetching everything you need in one
network request" as a superpower of GraphQL and honestly it _really_
is. It can however be very difficult when we enter a route to know
what data every component will need to render their content, let's be
honest, if we'd have to check the root GraphQL query every time we
add new logic that's not a great developer experience.

When we think about how we author for instance our front-end
web-applications we define our components and what data they return.
GraphQL has a similar concept named [Fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments),
in a fragment we can specify a condition and when that condition is met
what data we want to receive.

```graphql
fragment Avatar_UserFields on User {
  avatar {
    url
    isCircular
  }
}
```

When the above example fragment is used in a GraphQL document it will be "spread"
into a field, asking for the fields specified in this fragment. Fragments
enable us to specify the data-requirements of a component and bubble it up
alongside our component tree so it can be composed into a set of root requirements.

```graphql
query {
  users(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        ...Avatar_UserFields
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above case however fails to show how arguments would work in fragments, imagine
we can specify dimensions to our `url` which will influence what kind of URL our server
returns.

```graphql
fragment Avatar_UserFields on User {
  avatar {
    url(width: $width, height: $height)
    isCircular
  }
}
```

Now... We kind of have an issue as we're back to the initial problem, we'd have to bubble up
our variables to the root-query as well as ensure that the variables we use in the fragment
are actually present where this fragment is used...

```graphql
query ($width: Int!, $height: Int) {
  users(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        ...Avatar_UserFields
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This doesn't quite feel right, when we'd alter the query in any way or use this fragment in a different query
we'd have to recursively check all fragments whether the variable actually exist. We'd see runtime
issues yes, this type of issue however is something we want to catch when we are developing.

Relay has had a proven solution to this problem for a while, in the shape of
[two directives named arguments and argumentDefinitions](https://relay.dev/docs/api-reference/graphql-and-directives/#arguments).
These can be apllied on a fragment-spread and fragment-definition, if we'd apply this to the above example
we'd get

```graphql
query ($width: Int!, $height: Int) {
  users(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        ...Avatar_UserFields @arguments(width: $width, height: $height)
      }
    }
  }
}

fragment Avatar_UserFields on User @argumentDefinitions(
  width: {type: "Int"},
  height: {type: "Int"}
) {
  avatar {
    url(width: $width, height: $height)
    isCircular
  }
}
```

The above is statically analysable and will be able to warn in our editor.
Relays compiler will ensure that this is properly validated and transpiled
to a format that our GraphQL server can understand.
The issue here being that it's only available in Relay...
While this seems to be a fundamental missing piece in how we author
our GraphQL documents...

There has been a proposal for [fragment-arguments](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1010)
from 2023 and my own 2024 [amended version](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1081) of the aformentioned proposal.
With this proposal we'd effectively allow fragments to define variables similar
to what we can do on an operation level:

```graphql
fragment Avatar_UserFields (
  $width: Int
  $height: Int
) on User {
  avatar {
    url(width: $width, height: $height)
    isCircular
  }
}
```

When a fragment defines variables we'll be able to pass them on through the fragment-spread

```graphql
query ($width: Int!, $height: Int) {
  users(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        ...Avatar_UserFields(width: $width, height: $height)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This looks a bit more GraphQL native and would allow for any GraphQL client
to support this missing piece to fragment composition.

I would love any thoughts on the [Spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1081)
and [JS-implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4015) pull requests if you have any!

As an aside, one missing DX feature to the above proposal currently would be an integration into GraphiQL's
language service package, this would enable tools like GraphQLSP and vscode-graphql to recognise this feature
and provide hints while authoring fragment-spreads.

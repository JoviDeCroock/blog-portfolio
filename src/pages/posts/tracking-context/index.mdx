# Understanding Tracking Context in Preact Signals

One of the most misunderstood aspects of Preact Signals is how tracking context works and the difference between `.value` and `.peek()`.

## What is Tracking Context?

A tracking context is an environment where signal access is monitored and subscriptions are automatically created.
When you access a signal's `.value` property within a tracking context, that context becomes subscribed to changes in the signal.

There are three main types of tracking contexts in Preact Signals:

1. **Computeds** - Derived values that update when their dependencies change
2. **Effects** - Side effects that run when their dependencies change
3. **Components** - React/Preact components that re-render when signals change

## Computeds

Computed signals are perhaps the most elegant example of tracking context.
They automatically track which signals they depend on and only recalculate when those dependencies change.

```javascript
import { signal, computed } from "@preact/signals";

const count = signal(0);
const name = signal("John");

// This computed will only track 'count' because we only access count.value
const doubleCount = computed(() => {
  console.log("Computing double count...");
  return count.value * 2;
});

// The computed is NOT active yet - no computation has happened
console.log("Computed created, but not evaluated");

// NOW it becomes active and runs for the first time
console.log(doubleCount.value); // Logs: "Computing double count..." then "0"

// Accessing again returns cached value
console.log(doubleCount.value); // No log, returns cached "0"

// Changing 'name' won't trigger the computed because it's not a dependency
name.value = "Jane"; // No computation

// But changing 'count' will trigger it
count.value = 5; // Still no computation yet...
console.log(doubleCount.value); // Logs: "Computing double count..." then "10"
```

Computeds are **lazy** - they only become active when first accessed via `.value`, and they only track signals that are actually accessed during their computation.

## Effects

Effects run when their tracked signals change, similar to computeds but for side effects rather than derived values.

```javascript
import { signal, effect } from "@preact/signals";

const count = signal(0);
const name = signal("John");

// This effect tracks both count and name
effect(() => {
  console.log(`Hello ${name.value}, count is ${count.value}`);
});
// Immediately logs: "Hello John, count is 0"

count.value = 1; // Logs: "Hello John, count is 1"
name.value = "Jane"; // Logs: "Hello Jane, count is 1"
```

Effects run immediately when created, establishing their tracking context during the initial execution. It is worth noting
that when you use `async` actions within the effect that only the synchronous accessed signals will be registered. When
the synchronous part ends we have left the tracking-context.

## Components

When using the `@preact/signals` package with Preact (or `@preact/signals-react` with React), components automatically become tracking contexts during render.

```javascript
import { signal } from "@preact/signals";

const count = signal(0);
const theme = signal("light");

function Counter() {
  // Accessing count.value during render subscribes this component to count changes
  // Component will re-render when count changes
  const currentCount = count.value;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {currentCount}</p>
      <button onClick={() => count.value++}>
        Increment
      </button>
      {/* Passing the signal itself doesn't create a subscription */}
      <ThemeToggle themeSignal={theme} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ThemeToggle({ themeSignal }) {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        // Accessing .value in event handlers is safe - no tracking context here
        themeSignal.value = themeSignal.value === "light" ? "dark" : "light";
      }}
    >
      Toggle theme
    </button>
  );
}
```

Only synchronous access to `.value` during the render phase creates subscriptions.
Event handlers, async operations, and other code outside the render tracking context don't create component subscriptions,
this means that even though `themeSignal` changes from `ThemeToggle`, we won't rerender `ThemeToggle` because
we [actively prevent this](https://github.com/preactjs/signals/blob/main/packages/preact/src/index.ts#L369).

## When Tracking Context Doesn't Apply

Not every code location is a tracking context. These scenarios don't create subscriptions:

```javascript
import { signal } from "@preact/signals";

const count = signal(0);

// Global scope - no tracking context
console.log(count.value); // No subscription

// Event handlers - no tracking context
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log(count.value); // No subscription
});

// Async operations - no tracking context
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(count.value); // No subscription
}, 1000);

// Promise handlers - no tracking context
fetch('/api/data').then(() => {
  console.log(count.value); // No subscription
});
```

## Conclusion

Understanding tracking context is key to mastering Preact Signals. Remember:

- **Tracking contexts** automatically subscribe to signals accessed via `.value`
- **Computeds** are lazy and only track signals accessed during computation
- **Components** subscribe to signals accessed during render (synchronously)
- **Event handlers and async code** don't create tracking contexts
- **`.peek()`** and **`untracked()`** let you escape tracking when needed (rarely)

The beauty of signals lies in their automatic dependency tracking - you rarely need to think about subscriptions explicitly.
When you do need to escape tracking context, `.peek()` and `untracked()` provide precise control over when subscriptions are created.
Note that the need to escape this should be rare.

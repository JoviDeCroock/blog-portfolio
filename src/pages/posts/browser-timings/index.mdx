# Timings

While exploring [a bug](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/3596) we found a weird quirk where a DOM event seemingly
bubbled higher up to a not-yet existing DOM-element. This is in practice not possible but it leads us on a path towards
the solution.

When we start exploring this bug it's easy to tell people to call `e.stopPropagation()` as in fact it solves the issue,
but that only fits the case where we aren't relying on the bubbling to impact other nodes on its path. When someone pointed
at this possibly being timing-related it was worth looking at how the DOM handles these, which brings us to an interesting finding.

> When following along you won't experience this bug if you are using Safari!

```js
const defer = Promise.prototype.then.bind(Promise.resolve());

function App() {
  function onChange() {
    console.log("onChange");
    defer(() => {
      console.log("onChange - microtick delay");
    });
  }

  function onClick() {
    console.log("onClick");
    defer(() => {
      console.log("onClick - microtick delay");
    });
  }

  return (
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      onChange={onChange}
      checked={true}
      onClick={onClick}
    />
  );
}
```
<Example />

For people who aren't familiar with the above practice of `Promise.prototype.then.bind(Promise.resolve());` we are essentially
deferring the callback with one microtick, this is intended to let the browser batch up more work before we execute it.

Consider the following example:

```js
const defer = Promise.prototype.then.bind(Promise.resolve());
const commands = []

function addWork(command) {
  commands.unshift(command);
  defer(() => { flush(); })
}

function flush() {
  if (!commands.length) return;
  console.log('flushing')
  let command;
  while(command = commands.pop()) command()
}

addWork(() => { console.log('task 1') })
addWork(() => { console.log('task 2') })
addWork(() => { console.log('task 3') })
addWork(() => { console.log('task 4') })
```

We will add four items of work before executing on our flush! Feel free to copy paste that in your developer console and you
will see the following logs: `flushing task 1 task 2 task 3 task 4` so one flush that executes all 4 tasks.

That being said, let's return to the example, open your console and click the checkbox a few times.
Isn't it weird how the `defer` here actually isn't working? We see `click - microtick - change - microtick`, this because the DOM
also performs it's own delays, let's extend this to our issue report.

```js
const defer = Promise.prototype.then.bind(Promise.resolve());

function App() {
  function bubbled() {
    console.log('bubbled')
  }

  function original() {
    console.log('original')
    defer(() => {
      console.log('microtick after original')
    })
  }

  return (
    <div onClick={bubbled}>
      <div onClick={original}>Click me!</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
<Issue />

So what we see here in terms of logs would be `original - microtick after original - bubbled`, well that's akward... in
Preact we use this `defer` heuristic to batch updates to the DOM, you can find the relevant code [here](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/10.9.0/src/component.js#L181).
Batching state updates has been in Preact for a long time and enables us to do less work as we group a set of updates happening and then order them from top to bottom and
execute them all at once.

In relation to the issue the microtick issue means that when we click the inner-div from the issue,
we first execute the whole update in Preact and only after we can start bubbling,
this makes it so that the event bubbles up to the newly created DOM-node and immediately undo'es the applied state-update!

We can fix this by for instance using `const defer = setTimeout` which essentially should not pose risk and allows us to batch state-updates
across bubbling and events!

After analyzing all of this we discovered that there were two more bugs related to this very issue [#2887](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/2887)
and [#2745](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/2745). People experiencing this issue can already bypass this today by leveraging the options api.

```js
import { options } from 'preact'

options.debounceRendering = setTimeout
```

which will replace the built-in defer with your own, similarly you can experiment with other scheduling API's if you feel adventurous!
Some examples of scheduling alternatives would be [requestIdleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback)
and [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame).

Personally I am really looking forward to seeing how the [Scheduler API](https://www.w3.org/TR/task-scheduler/) turns out!

# Virtual Dom and compilers

As one of the core maintainers of Preact I think a lot about Virtual DOM and how to optimize it, there are a lot of
optmizations that are easy to miss in Virtual DOM. We often get told to leverage `shouldComponentUpdate` or `memo` to
avoid excessive rerendering of a component.
These are a few of the more obvious optmizations as they are explicitly documented and we can reaon about them while
we explicitly use them. Let's look at a few of the less obvious ones, in the examples we'll notice that a rerender of
a component will switch the border-color for a bit so we can see how many times everything rerenders.

## Equal state

When we look at the example of `setState` we have a few advantages with using simple values like a string/number/... as
opposed to an object or array. It's much easier for a library to assess whether these are equal

<StateEquality />

In the big picture this looks obvious but in some situations this can lead to some unexpected cases

## Strict equality

... yes...

## Partial hydration

This is one that we spent quite some time on in Preact...

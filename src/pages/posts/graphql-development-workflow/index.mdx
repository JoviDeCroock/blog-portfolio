# GraphQL Development Workflow

I think 2023 was the first year where I got my thoughts straight on how
my ideal GraphQL development workflow looks like. To no surprise the folks working
on [Relay](https://relay.dev) had already long figured this out.

A common issue that showed up for me when going the non-relay path was that
a lot of the tools for the aforementioned workflow weren't obvious or were
hard to combine. This has been improving over the last few years but there's
still a lot of missing educational content in the GraphQL space on how to
leverage and combine the existing tools.

This post will largely focus on (P)React but the concepts should be applicable
to any other component-based framework.

## Query once

When I think about schema-design my goto is to think about entry-points and
how these entry-points relate to your front-end. Let's put that to practice,
for instance when we enter [the Puma womens shoes](https://us.puma.com/us/en/women/shoes)
page we are on a `Category` type, when I open the network-tab I see four GraphQL
queries fire, I'll focus on `CategoryPLP` for the sake of this example.

When we look at the query we see that it has a root-field called `categoryByURL` which
describes the intent here, we want to get our category by the URL we are on. This query
then expands into `products` which is a paginated list of products relating to
the category, just like we see on the page.

```graphql
## Simplified version
query CategoryPLP {
  categoryByURL(url: $url) {
    id
    name
    description
    seo {
      title
      description
    }
    products {
      filterOptions { label value }
      nodes {
        id
        name
        imageUrl
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is my goal when I think about GraphQL, we enter a page and for that body
we fire one query where the selection hierarchy of the query roughly follows
the information architecture of the page. This makes the query easy to reason
about and it will act as a means of communication to supply the resources for
the blueprint expressed by your components and pages code.

### Fragments

During development it would be really difficult when you are working on i.e. a
`ProductCard` component to have to go to the `CategoryPLP` query to add a field
every time you notice you are missing some data. This is where [fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)
come in and more specifically co-locating fragments with your components.

```tsx
export const ProductCardFragment = grapql(`
  fragment ProductCardFields on Product {
    id
    name
    imageUrl
  }
`)

export const ProductCard = (props: { product: FragmentType<typeof ProductCardFragment> }) => {
  const { product } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={product.imageUrl} />
      <h2>{product.name}</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the above component when we need to add i.e. the `price` field we can just
go in the `ProductCardFragment` and add `price` to the selection-set. This is
being spread into the parent-query and it will be automatically fetched and passed
into the `ProductCard` component. No more needing to figure out whether something
is present in the data or not.

### Dynamic components

Not all pieces of the UI will be present on the first render, I refer to these
as dynamic components, think about pressing a delete button and a modal poppping up.
These components will also need data and they are not crucial to the first-render
so it would be wasteful for them to be fetched on the first render.

There are a few options here in terms of how to fetch this data, we can use
the `@include` [directive](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives)
to conditionally fetch the data based on the variable that dictates whether
the component is visible or not. The other option, my preferred one,
being that the component itself is responsible for fetching the data it needs.

The latter option basically starts a new data-tree where the components of our
dynamic piece of UI will dictate their data-requirements upwards.

## LSP

Telling you to "just add fields" is all fine, however you might not be aware
of the fields available on your schema. Historically this could be solved by
surfing to the [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) endpoint of your
GraphQL server and exploring the schema there. This was a pretty manual process
and left room for improvement. The [GraphQL VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql)
solved a lot of that but doesn't really work with tagged-template literals, ...

This is why we decided to work on [GraphQLSP](https://github.com/0no-co/GraphQLSP)
which does similar things to the VSCode plugin but works with template interpolations
and global fragments. It's a TypeScript plugin and it will give you auto-complete,
diagnostics and hover information for your GraphQL documents. Additionally we wanted
to have some of those fantastic Relay features, like it for instance telling you
that a field is unused or a fragment import is missing.

There's probably a lot more we can do here, for instance add warnings for making `$limit`
a variable as folks can play with this to DOS attack your server, ... This ties back to
[`persisted-operations`](./persisted-operations) where these checks could mean the
difference between locking down your API or exposing a vulnerability.

This is all a work-in-progress and we encourage any feature request!

## Types

One of the advantages of GraphQL is that it has a type-system which we can enforce on the client,
but how do we get our queries to have static typings that work with i.e. TypeScript...

Honestly shoutout to [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/) who have worked so much on providing us
with many tools tools that enable people in the GraphQL world both on the client as well as on the server.
I think [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) is one of the most important tools
when you are working on client-side GraphQL and it's also the tool we'll talk about here to get our static-typings
into our front-end code.

Some time ago the [client-preset](https://the-guild.dev/blog/unleash-the-power-of-fragments-with-graphql-codegen)
was introduced as a way to encourage fragment co-location and provide typings that
lead you to success!

What it enables you to do is the following:

```tsx
import { graphql, useFragment, FragmentType } from '@/generated/gql'
import { ProductCard } from './ProductCard'
import { SEO } from './ProductCard'

const CategoryQuery = graphql(`
  query CategoryPLP {
    categoryByURL(url: $url) {
      id
      name
      seo {
        ...SEOFields
      }
      products {
        nodes {
          id
          ...ProductCardFields
        }
      }
    }
  }
`)

export function UserProfileRoute_Query() {
  const [result] = useQuery(CategoryQuery)

  const { categoryByURL: category } = result.data

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{category.name}</h1>
      <SEO seo={category.seo}>
      {category.products.nodes.map((product) => (
        <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
      ))}
    </main>
  )
}
```

All of the above is statically typed and if we were to i.e. not spread in
`ProductCardFields` we would get a TypeScript error telling us that we are
not adhering to the type of `ProductCard`.

They even give you a handy fragment-masking method in the generated types! I personally
have the `code-generator` running at all times as a bash command or I try to
incorporate it into `vite`/`next` so that it runs during development.

## Future

In a future post I would love to go more into the runtime and operational
side of things, I haven't fully gotten my thoughts straightened out on how
that _should_ look but I have some ideas.

For the runtime I would love to go deeper on partial data and nullability,
a lot of GraphQL clients leverage normalised caches which more often than not
enable us to show partial data. In the current state of the art there isn't
really a good way to tell a cache what can be missing and what can't be. You
can inform this with the schema but that's not always enough, you also don't
want any missing data to be allowed as navigating from page x to page z might
result in different partial data compared to navigating from page y to page z.
I am a big fan of [client controlled nullability](https://github.com/graphql/client-controlled-nullability-wg)
but it looks like the working-group is moving to a new direction with
[strict semantic nullability](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1410)
which might re-introduce the concept of needing a schema (which is also heavy on initial page load...).
I honestly haven't read up enough about this spec and how it compares to client
controlled nullability.

For the operational side of things I would need to develop a clearer picture of
all the things that go into managing a schema, logs, performance, ... at scale.

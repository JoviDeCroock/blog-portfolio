# Declarative data requirements

In our front-ends we'll refer to server-side rendering to increase performance,
please crawlers, and making the app work without JavaScript enabled on the client.
To achieve this we go through quite a bit of trouble. frameworks like `Next`, `Gatsby`,...
aim to alleviate this concern from us and don't get me wrong, they do a great job,
but what makes all of this so hard that we need these?

Let's look at how we approach this on the client and then move on to the issues we have on the server.

## Client-side

When we are on the client we'll often declare our data-requirements in `componentDidMount` or a `useEffect`
(pick your poison), we'll `await` the `Promise` and set it in our state, that's the simplest case we have to
visualize data located in an API inside of our API. Notice how all the rendering just continues, a placeholder
is where that data is supposed to be and the world just seemingly stands still until the API response has been delivered.
When the data arrives we call `setState` and our Virtual-DOM library will know that it's time to show some new things on screen,
these new things could in turn have their own data-requirements and we could be creating a waterfall of spinners.

## Not only magicians create suspense...

The Suspense was killing me too waiting for this part. For those who don't know the concept of `Suspense` it is essentially
a way to abstract the loading states that we enter in the above. We call our `Promise` and store it in state, rather than
checking whether we are still `fetching` inside of our `render` function we use the `throw` keyword from JS and rather than
throwing an error we `throw` that `Promise` up, when a `Suspense` boundary catches this it will render a loading state.

```js
let globData;
const getData = () => {
  if (globData) return globData;
  return new Promise(res => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      res(globData = [{ id: 1, name: 'Jovi De Croock' }])
    }, 500);
  })
}

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(getData)

  if (data.then) {
    throw data;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(person => <span key={person.id}>{person.name}</span>)}
    </div>
  )
}

render(<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}><App /></Suspense>)
```

<Suspense />

In the above we can see that we fetch data and when it resolves the `fallback` UI dissapears and we render the intended display of todo's.
This abstraction however does more, when we have a waterfall, we can stay in the `fallback` state without any problem as the
subsequent loading state will `throw` up and it can be caught in a new boundary or the same one making the loading state
consistent until all data loads in.

## Server-side

When we approach the concept of server-side rendering we'll often refer to stringifying the HTML and sending it to the client,
rendering to string as it stands is a synchronous process where we don't invoke lifecycles and just call `render` until we have
passed through the whole tree. It's important to take this single pass in consideration when we consider the 'world standing still'
while we resolve data on the client. A server-side render does not support doing multiple passes through the data, which
means we'll be rendering the loading spinners rather than our data as while the world stands still we'll take the string-snapshot
and sent it to the client.

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'preact/hooks'
import renderToString from 'preact-render-to-string'

const getData = () => new Promise(res => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    res([{ id: 1, name: 'Jovi De Croock' }])
  }, 500);
})

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: [],
      isLoading: true
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    getData().then(data => {
      this.setState({ isLoading: false, data })
    })
  }

  render(props, { isLoading, data }) {
    if (isLoading) {
      return <p>loading...</p>
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {data.map(person => <span key={person.id}>{person.name}</span>)}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

const stringifiedHTML = renderToString(<App />)
```
<RenderToString />

We don't invoke lifecycles, effects, ... during a render-to-string as we won't react to state-updates anyway, also how would the
render to string process even know when all data is resolved? Popular frameworks have introduced concepts like `getServerSideProps`
which allows us to run a function when the page renders and resolve the data-requirements, this gives us observability into the
data actually finishing the loading state and is actually great as we execute 1 `Promise` and then 1 `render-to-string`, no waterfalls, ...
This concept however gives us 1 more thing to think about, how great would it be if we could just leverage the virtual-dom to define our
data requirements and it would automatically work? Well it's possible, a few years ago Formidable came with a library named `react-ssr-prepass`
which essentially leverages the concept of `Suspense` throwing Promises up the tree to resolve data.

This means that we would invoke `prepass` and then go on to `render-to-string`, as long as we don't reach the end of the tree (due to Promises
being thrown) prepass would know it has not resolved all the data requirements. This brings one important pitfall to be aware of, the
waterfalls that could be acceptable on the client will be causing a _huge delay_ in the HTML skeleton arriving. Another thing to consider is that
we'll need a client/... that supports caching the responses we get during the `prepass`, because when we follow the `prepass` with our `renderToString`
we'll need to be able to synchronously retrieve the data. We will also need to be able to send the data back to the client so the data-cache can be hydrated
and the dom-hydration can complete elegantly.

At the time of writing React has given us React 18 which brings support for asynchronous `renderToString`, do note that this async `renderToString` won't resolve
data either, it will render the `Suspense` fallback instead.

## Concluding

I do hope this gives some insight into the trouble front-end frameworks have gone through when we reason about server-side renders and data, this post
deliberately leaves out client-side data-hydration as there is also a lot to write about that as well.

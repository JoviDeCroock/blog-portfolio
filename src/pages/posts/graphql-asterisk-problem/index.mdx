# The GraphQL Asterisk Problem: When Benefits Come with Caveats

Let‚Äôs start off by looking at what GraphQL had to offer and why it was such a groundbreaking innovation. When GraphQL came to the stage it boasted its
[pillars](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sel-CADDPAAERJBlI2gH), you can look at the link but I‚Äôll re-iterate them here shortly

- **Product-centric,** GraphQL should be driven by the requirements of your clients
- **Hierarchical**, the data reflects the UI hierarchy
- **Strong-typing**, leveraging GraphQL should enable the client to derive types and leverage them
- **Client-specified response,** the client tells the server exactly what it wants and does not expect the response to include more
- **Introspective,** the system used by the GraphQL server is transparently query-able

Now all of this is quite abstract and has been generalised in a few benefits that, if you ask me, do not paint the full picture of what GraphQL gives you.

- Common API Contract (Rust server - TS client, Go server - Rust client, ‚Ä¶.)
- Single endpoint
- Better API-Versioning
- Avoid overfetching
- Declarative data fetching
- Strong typing
- Self documenting

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, a lot of these are true but they always come with an asterisk.

GraphQL is indeed self-documenting, if you go through the effort of properly describing your inputs and outputs. A big win for DX if done correctly.

GraphQL is strongly typed, that one can‚Äôt be argued with, however please setup GraphQL Code Generator or gql.tada on the client and pothos or
GraphQL Code Generator on the server to actually achieve strong typings.
These strong typings ensure your logic avoids common issues both on server as well as client, this is a big strength, a win in both DX and UX.

GraphQL allows you to declaratively fetch data, however without [Fragment co-location](https://gql-tada.0no.co/guides/fragment-colocation)
this becomes challenging as one will always have to navigate to the parent-query to add a field.
This opens its own can of worms because of [GraphQL‚Äôs missing primitive](https://www.jovidecroock.com/blog/graphqls-missing-feature). This should be a win in DX,
more often than not it‚Äôs a pain in DX though.

GraphQL allows you to avoid over-fetching, however the proper LSP tooling is missing from the ecosystem Relay and GraphQLSP try their very best but
with all of the ways to author GraphQL documents there is no great way to achieve this monitoring at scale.
I‚Äôd argue that a bigger strength of GraphQL comes from combining declarative data-fetching and strong typing, we actually
avoid under fetching, we are assured that the types reflect the possibility of absence and presence of data which leads to less issues.

GraphQL allows for a different kind of API-Versioning, I personally would not use the word ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù to prefix that. We are encouraged to work
versionless, which for GraphQL API‚Äôs that are used internally is possible and fun as you don‚Äôt have to switch up URL‚Äôs but for public API‚Äôs this is an absolute PAIN.
According to this philosophy you have to support fields forever, despite the shape of your product/business changing, this is unrealistic.
Versionless is unrealistic, we have to change and we have to do breaking/dangerous changes, that‚Äôs the reality of engineering.

Single endpoint, I hope hope hope that nobody sees this as a strength‚Ä¶ It makes for a network console that just looks like `/graphql` ad infinitum.
In production GraphQL should be compiled into Persisted Operations which ideally look like `/operations/<some-hash>/<operation-name>` which reads
an awful lot better and is easier to observe in metrics.

  üí° Heck when you use traditional GraphQL as advertised you even lose HTTP
  caching‚Ä¶ ‚òπÔ∏è¬†my issue here is more with the GraphQL-HTTP specification than
  anything else but still, we need to mention this.

---

Now this might have looked like one big rant, believe me we are going somewhere. From the above we can derive that GraphQL, when done well,
makes life easier on developers that have multiple clients to manage (mobile, web, CLI, ‚Ä¶.). Doing it well, however, might be difficult
given the state of tooling outside of Relay for clients and well just hard when you consider the server-side.

In recent years a lot of ‚Äúalternatives for GraphQL‚Äù have visited the spotlight, tRPC, oRPC, bespoke endpoints or just traditional REST.
All of these have their improvements and regressions compared to GraphQL and all of these technologies carry their merit,
I will in no way shape or form say that any of these is bad, engineering is a craft of tradeoffs that we at all times have to respect.

Looking at the alternatives gives us a clear picture of what GraphQL could improve on and the unique strengths the technology _could_ offer
if we capitalize on the strengths and improve on the weaknesses.

## REST: The Dinosaur always having its nest in our hearts

Traditional REST(ful) endpoints are a powerhouse, they‚Äôve never _really_ left the scene. When people talk about REST they often mean bespoke endpoints
so let‚Äôs clarify, a REST API will return its resource without relations. A bespoke endpoint will return data tailored to a certain view, this could be an
enhanced resource like the cart with all its products.

When we leverage REST we naturally start creating waterfalls when we deal with rich UI applications, when we render a view we‚Äôll get the base resource,
which potentially has multiple other resources. Let‚Äôs say we get a movie and we now need to get every actor, in a rich UI this can hurt performance unless cached well.
Flashback to GraphQL, where HTTP semantics are often left out of the initial conversation, in REST this is _never_ a tradeoff you have to use REST well.

The issue is that if you want to use REST _and_ have good typings that you are often left to explore options like OpenAPI specs, ‚Ä¶
and honestly these are also a lot of work while being less strict compared to GraphQL. In GraphQL if you define a certain shape of your
schema and don‚Äôt return that shape it won‚Äôt work, while in REST you would need to create additional tooling for that.

If you are creating a CMS where you are looking at individual resources and developing that way, REST is probably hella awesome.
Tangentially, if you are creating a public API for anyone to consume, REST is probably the most accessible format for your users.
You can version freely by leveraging the URL, you can tell people to just surf to a URL and see their data, everything is all fine and dandy.

## The tRPC Promise: Type Safety Without the Complexity

`tRPC` when I was first introduced to it felt like a refreshing newcomer and honestly, an absolutely amazing idea. It has the typing advantages of GraphQL,
very similar even. it also does one thing _extremely_ well where GraphQL fails, it unifies tooling and forces opinions on you. `tRPC` took `react-query` (now named tanstack-query)
and used that as an opinionated way for clients to interact well with its endpoints. There‚Äôs no doubt or war going on about how you do `tRPC` well,
it allows you to just spin up an app and rapidly evolve it.

The caveat to all of this is that `tRPC` is designed to use TypeScript on both the server as well as the client,
a constraint we don‚Äôt have with GraphQL due to its API contract being defined as a common language.

When we evolve into multiple clients apart from our let‚Äôs say Next.JS application we will have to start packaging up these `tRPC` types or
have some kind of monorepo orchestration to ensure that our new client has the benefits of being strongly typed with the data it receives from our endpoints.

If the above isn‚Äôt a concern because you only have 1 client, or you are using a tool to author mobile/web in one repository then `tRPC` is
probably one of the best choices. Typings, a strong community, opinions and awesome maintainers. The [setup](https://trpc.io/docs/quickstart) is also so
much easier than GraphQL, thanks to their opinions you don‚Äôt have to make 10 choices before even getting started.

In relation to REST, we could consider `tRPC` a form of bespoke endpoints with a good API contract.

Team size matters here, it‚Äôs harder to work on a large distributed team with `tRPC` due to the documentation generally being a manual thing,
or even a JSDoc concern. I am not at all saying this is a bad thing but the introspective nature of GraphQL or the OpenAPI approach is easier to
work with in a distributed manner‚Ä¶ The question remains, with machines evolving and writing more code whether teams and organizations will
remain the sizes they have today.

`tRPC` purely from the documentation feels very React-centric, I reckon that nothing is React specific.
Tanstack query is available on more libraries so I reckon this limitation is more educational rather than fundamental.
There is documentation for vanilla clients as well, it just feels less first-class compared to the recommendation.

## Server-Driven UI: The Dark Horse

I will start this one off with a disclaimer as I am personally less experienced with this compared to the others that I‚Äôve just discussed.
We‚Äôve seen a resurgence in servers returning a format that tells the client how to render, AirBnB has talked about [this](https://www.facebook.com/AirbnbTech/videos/1445539065813160/)
and React in recent years has increasingly pushed server components as their way to do this.

I will focus my attention on React Server Components because at the very least I have read and experimented the most with that,
I am a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) maintainer and we have done our own experiments with a paradigm like this.

When a client requests a certain view, the server will fetch its data and return the UI description.
In React this can be a JSON representation of their Virtual UI tree which the client can then use to translate into UI elements,
I explicitly say Virtual UI and UI elements as this is applicable to Native, terminal UI as well as web.

The above means that a server-endpoint _could_ be made to express the UI of multiple clients,
I doubt that you‚Äôd want the same UI for multiple clients but it means abstractions can be shared throughout to cater to multiple clients.
Heck, React-Native-Web and expo are proving that it‚Äôs possible to share a codebase that caters to web and mobile while still having a great experience on both.

The static typing concern is less prolific here as you‚Äôre handling data on the server,
the experience can be integrated meaning you can pass data over props and automatically you‚Äôll be typing things correctly,
unless you use `any` - yes I am looking judgingly at you.

My main concern with server-driven UI is that either you are a full-stack developer and call your datasource directly,
this probably doesn‚Äôt scale all that well when you do have to cater multiple devices,
if you don‚Äôt do this then you‚Äôll end up calling an API which returns to REST/GraphQL/‚Ä¶ so I guess this is a half-alternative.
Another concern that comes up is that this is highly React specific, both the fact that it caters to many types of clients a well as the technology itself.

I do think that for prototyping it‚Äôs amazing to just have this integrated way of calling your database directly and
having everything done for you, as you scale you remove the database calls and abstract it to the endpoints.

## What are you waiting for sir author?

One might wonder why after writing all of this I don‚Äôt just start working on it, and that would be a great question.
I have spent a lot of the past 7 years working on GraphQL and its ecosystem, I‚Äôve actually never seen anything
I‚Äôve made have a large impact on how we do things and sifting through all of the hate the technology gets is utterly exhausting.
My last effort was to fully revamp the GraphQL JS documentation site in the hopes that we might get GraphQL JS v17 in a good place for release,
despite all of that work and a good result the documentation website isn‚Äôt a hit. Furthermore it fails to address a lot of the concerns I have outlined in the above,
someone else has done a wonderful job in outlining a lot of it but public perception of GraphQL has been battered for the past 10 years, how do we get back from that?
How do we tell people that, given the tooling we had back then everything was overhyped but that the potential is still there, as a community GraphQL can get there,
community is all that matters.

But what should we improve on as an ecosystem?

- Encourage users to get started with Persisted Operations, this should be as easy as an init command
- For clients, create and document ways to author GraphQL operations that are statically typed and actually benefit from LSP tooling
- Document the caveats of the default approach, POST‚Äôing documents should _never_ ever ever ever be the default.
- For servers, call out that versionless is not the end all be all that is currently being sold to the ecosystem
- For servers, be explicit about the security concerns (CSRF, depth, ‚Ä¶)

I didn‚Äôt even start talking about client-side caching and all of these other topics that make GraphQL look so complex to beginners.

## Closing thoughts

We need ways to transmit data regardless of the shape of your client and the shape of your server, GraphQL as a technology and specification fills these shoes.
To fill them well, it needs a lot of love and attention from the community, it needs to be a community effort to make GraphQL a great experience for everyone.

For those who don‚Äôt know some of my work, I have maintained [urql](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql), the extensible GraphQL client, for 6 years,
I am the co-creator of [GraphQLSP](https://github.com/0no-co/GraphQLSP) (LSP that I talk about in the above) and [gql.tada](https://github.com/0no-co/gql.tada)
(automatic type derivation for documents, persisted operation tooling, Fragment co-location encouragement, ‚Ä¶).
I was one of the first engineers at [stellate](https://stellate.co/), the GraphQL CDN, o11y platform, ‚Ä¶. I have written a lot of tooling and libraries in this space.

Maybe there is a world where we just make GraphQL an implementation detail, we leverage its design to create a `tRPC` experience that works across languages,
GraphQL could be a great choice even for smaller teams if the community didn‚Äôt rely on you shooting yourself in the foot over and over before ever getting to a good state.

Maybe it‚Äôs all not as bad if you look at it trhrough another lens, from my eyes though, GraphQL requires wartime leadership and not favoring no change.
Public perception is in a bad spot and if we favor no change there, well‚Ä¶.

I am not advocating for anyone to 180 their data-stack, heck, whatever works for you is probably best.
I‚Äôd love to have more conversations about all of this, so this is also an open invitation if anyone wants to talk through any of this, just send me a DM/Reply/‚Ä¶

# GraphQL Abstract types and caching

An issue in GraphQL client's normalised caching are abstract types
and when you as a consumer run into them it can be really hard...

## Introduction

To get this we need to rewind a bit and look at the fundamentals of normalized caching,
and how it works conceptually. Let's say we get the following selection-set from our
client:

```graphql
query {
  pokemon(id: "1") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

A normalized cache will go over this and start checking whether or not it contains every field
by doing the following in order:

- `Cache.read('Query.pokemon(id: 1)')` - this will return either nothing or a pointer to the `Pokemon`
  in cache.
- `Cache.read('Pokemon:1.id')` - this will return either nothing or the `id` of the `Pokemon`
- `Cache.read('Pokemon:1.name')` - this will return either nothing or the `name` of the `Pokemon`

That's the gist of the operations that will be executed, the reason we can uniquely identify these
entities is because GraphQL exposes the `__typename` field on every object, which allows us to combine
a unique identifier and the name of the type to create a unique key.

If the entity isn't there we'll reach out to the server and we'll be able to write the response
in the cache with very similar steps.

Now the above is an ideal case, there are also going to be cases where we can't generate a key
for a given entity, in `urql` we call them embedded entities. This basically opts out of normalization
for these objects and will embed the object in the parent field.

```js
cacheExchange({
  keys: {
    Pokemon: p => p.id, // Default
    PokemonDimension: () => null, // embedded entity, will be embedded into Pokemon.dimension
  }
})
```

Now to add one more piece we'll look at an abstract type being queried...

```graphql
query {
  beast(id: "1") {
    id
    ... on Beast {
      name
    }
    ... on Pokemon {
      fleeRate
    }
    ... on Digimon {
      evolutionLevel
    }
  }
}
```

For clarity the schema looks like

```graphql
interface Beast {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Pokemon implements Beast {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  fleeRate: Float!
}

type Digimon implements Beast {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  evolutionLevel: Int!
}

type Query {
  beast(id: ID!): Beast
}
```

The steps we'll go through to resolve this query will be the following

- `Cache.read('Query.beast(id: 1)')` - this will return either nothing or a pointer to the `Pokemon|Digimon`
  in cache.
- `Cache.read('(Pokemon|Digimon):1.id')` - this will return either nothing or the `id` of the `Pokemon|Digimon`
- `Cache.read('(Beast):1.name')` - this will return either nothing or the `name` of the `Beast` --> Problematic as we'll never
  see this `__typename` as the server will always reply with a concrete type of `Pokemon` or `Digimon` meaning that we'll never
  be able to resolve this field as we can't be sure whether this is a concrete or abstract-type.
- `Cache.read('(Pokemon):1.fleeRate')` - this will return either nothing or the `fleeRate` of the `Pokemon`
- `Cache.read('(Digimon):1.evolutionLevel')` - this will return either nothing or the `evolutionLevel` of the `Digimon`

When we are writing to the cache we'll always write with the `__typename` we are given and we'll check the fragments
whether they heuristically match the response. This means that if we get back a `Pokemon` `fleeRate` will be found in the
response and `name` will be found in the response meaning that these two responses heuristically match. We won't be able
to find `evolutionLevel` in the response so we can ignore that fragment.

The issue here becomes that for a Pokemon we'll get the `name` and `fleeRate` returned while for a Digimon we'll get the `name` and
`evolutionLevel` returned. The Beast Fragment represents the fields they have in common but as an abstract type will never be selection
explicitly.

## Interface fields

The above shows the issue that normalized caches face, to fix that you'll see solutions like
[Apollo's possibleTypes](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration#possibletypes) or
[urql's schema-awareness](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/graphcache/schema/#adding-interfaces-and-unions). Solutions like
these allow us to lookup each type and see that it's abstract which in turn allows us to resolve the selection-set by means of the
`__typename` of the implementing types.

Something that can be said is whether we can construct `possibleTypes` at query-time where we would see that `Pokemon` is returned, and
we see that it has the `name` property which would allow us to derive that by extension Pokemon is implementing the Beast interface.

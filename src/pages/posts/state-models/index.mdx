# Beyond Hooks: Why Signals and State Models

We've all been there, right? Managing state directly within our components using hooks like `useState` has become second nature for us (P)React developers.
While this approach works for simple cases, it often leads to tightly coupled code that's difficult to test, reuse, and reason about.
I want to explore a different paradigm using **Preact Signals** that promotes better separation of concerns through dedicated state models.

## The Problem with Hook-Centric State Management

Let's look at this typical React component using hooks:

```js
const TodoList = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('all')

  const addTodo = (text) => {
    setTodos([...todos, {
      id: Date.now(),
      text,
      completed: false
    }])
  }

  const toggleTodo = (id) => {
    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>
      todo.id === id
        ? {...todo, completed: !todo.completed}
        : todo
    ))
  }

  const completedCount =
    todos.filter(t => t.completed).length

  return (
    // JSX with business logic mixed in
  )
}
```

While functional, this approach has several drawbacks:

- **Your component becomes a dumping ground** for both presentation logic and business logic. Testing business rules requires rendering components, and reusing logic across different views becomes nearly impossible.
- **State is scattered** across multiple `useState` declarations, making it harder to understand the complete state shape and manage complex state transitions.
- **No clear domain model** exists - business concepts like "Todo" or "TodoList" don't exist as first-class entities in your code. Instead, they're just plain objects floating around in component state.
- **Performance implications** are real - every state change triggers component re-renders, even when only specific parts of the UI need to update.

## Enter Preact Signals: A Different Approach

Preact Signals offer a compelling alternative that promotes **separation of concerns** through dedicated state models. Let's reimagine our todo application:

### Creating Individual Todo Models

```js
import { computed, signal, type Signal } from '@preact/signals';

export type Todo = {
  id: number;
  text: Signal<string>;
  completed: Signal<boolean>;
  toggle: () => void;
};

export function createTodo(text: string): Todo {
  const textSignal = signal(text);
  const completed = signal(false);

  const toggle = () => {
    completed.value = !completed.value;
  };

  return {
    // Properties
    id: Date.now(),
    get text() {
      return textSignal.value;
    },
    get completed() {
      return completed.value;
    },
    // Actions
    toggle,
    set text(value: string) {
      textSignal.value = value;
    },
  };
}
```

Here, each `Todo` is a **self-contained model** with its own state and behavior. The `text` and `completed` properties are signals that can be observed and updated independently.
This means that we only re-render the parts that are subscribed to these properties rather than everything that uses the `TodoList` component, as we'd regularly see with hooks.

### Building Composite State Models

```js
export function createTodoList() {
  const list = signal<Todo[]>([]);

  const add = (todoText: string) => {
    list.value = [...list.value, createTodo(todoText)];
  };

  const remove = (id: number) => {
    list.value = list.value.filter(todo => todo.id !== id);
  };

  const completed = computed(() =>
    list.value.every((todo) => todo.completed.value),
  );
  const count = computed(() => list.value.length);
  const completedCount = computed(() =>
    completed.value.length,
  );

  return {
    // Views
    get items() {
      return list.value;
    },
    get count() {
      return count.value;
    },
    get completedItems() {
      return completed.value;
    },
    get completedCount() {
      return completedCount.value;
    },
    // Actions
    add,
    remove,
  };
}
```

The `createTodoList` function returns a **state model** that encapsulates all todo-related operations.
Notice how `completedItems` is a computed signal that automatically updates when any todo's completion status changes.

We can either create a singleton instance of this model or pass one through context, you can consider a signal a boxed value,
we only subscribe a component once `.value` is accessed, and it will re-compute when the value changes.

## The Benefits in Action

### **Clean Separation of Concerns**

Your components become purely presentational:

```js
import { TodoListContext } from './models/todoList';

const TodoList = () => {
  const todoList = useContext(TodoListContext);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Todos ({todoList.count})</h2>
      <ul>
        {todoList.items.map(todo => (
          <TodoItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} />
        ))}
      </ul>
      <AddTodoForm />
    </div>
  );
};

const TodoItem = ({ todo }) => (
  <li>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={todo.completed}
      onChange={todo.toggle}
    />
    <span>{todo.text}</span>
  </li>
);
```

### **Effortless Testing**

Business logic testing becomes straightforward since models are independent of React:

```js
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { createTodo, createTodoList } from './todoModels';

describe('Todo Model', () => {
  it('should toggle completion status', () => {
    const todo = createTodo('Learn Signals');
    expect(todo.completed).toBe(false);

    todo.toggle();
    expect(todo.completed).toBe(true);
  });
});

describe('TodoList Model', () => {
  it('should track completion status', () => {
    const todos = createTodoList();
    todos.add('Task 1');
    todos.add('Task 2');

    expect(todos.completedCount).toBe(0);

    todos.items.forEach(todo => todo.toggle());
    expect(todos.completedCount).toBe(2);
  });
});
```

### **Granular Reactivity**

Signals provide surgical updates. When a single todo's text changes,
only that specific component re-renders:

```js
const TodoItem = ({ todo }) => {
  // Only re-renders when THIS todo's signals change
  return (
    <li className={todo.completed ? 'completed' : ''}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={todo.text}
        onChange={
          (e) => todo.text = e.target.value
        }
      />
    </li>
  );
};
```

Stronger than that, when we use `preact` we could even use the boxed variant of our signal
and it would directly update the DOM-attribute or text-node. We can also further optimize
the granularity of our updates by using the
<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/preactjs/signals/blob/main/packages/preact/README.md#utility-components-and-hooks">`signal-utils`</a>
like `Show` and `For`.

### **Reusable Across Different Views**

Want to display todos in a different format? Just create a new component that uses the same model:

```js
const TodoSummary = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Total: {todoList.count}</p>
    <p>Completed: {todoList.completedCount}</p>
    <progress
      value={todoList.completedCount}
      max={todoList.count}
    />
  </div>
);
```

## Conclusion

While React hooks revolutionized state management by making it more functional and composable, Preact Signals take this evolution further by promoting **true separation of concerns**. By moving state and business logic into dedicated models, we achieve:

- **Better testability** through framework-independent business logic
- **Improved reusability** across different views and components
- **Enhanced performance** via granular reactivity
- **Clearer architecture** with explicit domain models
- **Easier debugging** with predictable state changes

The next time you find yourself writing `const [state, setState] = useState()`, consider whether that state belongs in a dedicated model instead. Your future self (and your teammates) will thank you for the cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

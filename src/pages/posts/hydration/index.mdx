# Hydration

We often talk about the concept of hydration and how the speed of it is vital to delivering a good experience, I want
to touch on some efforts we as the Preact team have done to optimize for this metric as well as how other tools are
aiming to shift us to a better place.

## Say what?

For people unfamiliar with the concept, hydration is the practice of making a HTML page interactive. When we execute the following
code-snippet

```jsx
import { render } from 'preact';

render(
  <button
    onClick={() => { console.log('Oh hi, nice to have you here') }}
  >Hello world</button>,
  document.body
);
```

We will replace anything inside `document.body` with a `button` that has a click-listener attached. When we server-side render
we will be receiving the following html.

```html
<body>
  <button>Hello world</button>
</body>
```

Which in and of itself does nothing, we can click the button however much we like it won't do anything, we could call `render` again
like the previous code-snipper but that would destroy and recreate the DOM. Instead we will call `hydrate`.

```jsx
import { hydrate } from 'preact';

hydrate(
  <button
    onClick={() => { console.log('Oh hi, nice to have you here') }}
  >Hello world</button>,
  document.body
);
```

Now Preact will go through the existing elements in `document.body` and match them up against what the Virtual-DOM is saying has to be there.
After this is executed our application will be interactive.

It is valuable to be aware of how this will occur in practice because we first get our HTML and our HTML file will contain a script tag
telling the client where to find the code that will make this page interactive. This means we are essentially dealing with a waterfall

> Download HTML --> Parse HTML --> Download JS --> Parse JS --> Execute hydration --> Page interactive

This means the bigger your JS/... the longer it will take before the user can click something or navigate further, this
is called the [Time To Interactive metric in the core-web-vitals metrics](https://web.dev/interactive/).

## Interactivity please

We want to optimize this time-to-interactive metric as it determines the usability of your application, imagine someone downloading the HTML
for your application and due to a large bundle size or a bad connection the JS loads in slow, now the users will be hitting buttons but nothing
will actually be happening... This is the valley between first paint and interactiveness.

From this we can conclude there's a few things we can do to make things interactive faster

- we leverage the platform `<a>` tags for our links, these work out of the box without JS, the SPA transitions however might not work
- we start inlining our event-handlers for critical paths in the application
- we reduce the code downloaded for the minimal interactivity
- we reduce the amount of surface hydration has to touch before being fully interactive

The two first are interesting paths and I highly suggest looking into how [Remix](https://remix.run/) is trying to shift the status quo there,
however for this post we will focus where front-end libraries like Preact can come in to help out.

A pretty native tool to reduce bundle-size for entry points have been `async routes`, as that is the first factor that will be variable in the
entry of an application, we split up in multiple routes which essentially all are unused code apart from the one route we render. This leads me
to the first usable heuristic in optimizing hydration, we introduce a helper to orchestrate these async loading states, currently we have these in
the shape of `lazy` and `Suspense` as well as in [Preact-ISO](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/tree/main/packages/preact-iso) (which we should
really generalize one day).

For the sake of familiarity let's look at the `Suspense` approach, when a route isn't loaded `lazy` will throw a `Promise` which follows a similar
pattern to error boundaries in that when we see `Suspense` we can stop there, render the `fallback` and go on with our lives. What if instead of just
rendering the fallback we look at whether there is DOM and mark this `Suspense` root as a pending hydration? At that point we have a deferred hydration
going on that progressively hydrates the whole application as components are coming in.

When we apply that to the deferred routes we see that our application becomes interactive in the following order:

```html
<body>
  <header><!-- some links --></header> <!-- Interactive in the first pass -->
  <main>
    <!--
      route content
      Interactive in the second pass
      when the route specific code arrives
    -->
  </main>
  </footer><!-- some links --></footer> <!-- Interactive in the first pass -->
</body>
```

This is a little known trick that currently actually already lives in Preact, I have actually created [a small demo](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/realworld/blob/main/src/index.js#L4)
years ago to show this. The demo goes a bit further as it also introduces the above concept for data-loading, as long as data isn't loaded it will suspend and use
the existing non-hydrated DOM.

## Islands of interactivity

There is another alternative in the [islands approach](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture), conceptually we can approach this as
removing all the parts we don't need and only hydrating little roots in our Virtual DOM. This all can happen at build-time and mainly introduces
heuristics to play with, for instance only hydrate when this island becomes visible. This works out well in
Tools pioneering this approach are [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) and [Capri](https://capri.build), these are definitley worth checking out
for your next project!

Hell, I have considered rewriting this very blog in either of them just because I love seeing these tools in action and
honestly I really should get some static-site generation in here for SEO... Oh and probably some styling as well as I am starting to notice that
my minimalism is even starting to disturb me...

Before choosing one of these approaches I always advise people to read up on the [different rendering techniques](https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/).
After writing about all of this I do want to shoutout my fellow maintainers on Preact [Jason](https://twitter.com/_developit) and [Marvin](https://twitter.com/marvinhagemeist)
as I would have never learned this much about all of the rendering techniques, hydration and Virtual-DOM without them.

There is so much innovation coming to this space when I look at streaming rendering, islands, ... and it honestly excites me beyond belief!

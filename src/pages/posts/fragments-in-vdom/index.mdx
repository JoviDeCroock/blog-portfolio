# Fragments in Virtual DOM

One thing that I've been amazed by while working on Preact is the
complexity introduced by something seemingly simple, the Fragment.

For people unfamiliar with the `Fragment` in Preact/React, it's a
Virtual DOM-structure that allows a component to return multiple
children.

> Not to be confused with the [GraphQL Fragment](../graphqls-missing-feature)

If you'd have a component that does the following

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <span>Hello</span>
  <span>World</span>
)
```

We'd complain and tell you that it would need to be wrapped with a
`Fragment` which essentially comes down to wrapping it with `Fragment`
or `\<\>`.

Now if we look at how a `Fragment` is implemented in Preact it's just a
component that returns its children.

```jsx
export const Fragment = props => props.children
```

> Any component that just returns its children can be considered a Fragment.

What makes this so complex? It creates an additional distinction between
the DOM and our virtual equivalent. When we would initially mount a component
that looks like the aforementioned `App` we'd do the following operations:

- Call `<App />` so we get the resulting VNodes
- We traverse them, first item we encounter is a `Fragment`
- We render the `Fragment` just to see it return its children
- We perform `appendChild()` twice for the `<span>`
- We populate each span with a text-node

```
VDOM:
<App>
  <Fragment>
    <span>hello</span>
    <span>world</span>

DOM:
<span>hello</span>
<span>world</span>

```

That wasn't complex at all, and I am completely with you. The complexity starts
when we are unmounting and guaranteeing the correct ordering, when we are mounting
new nodes. Let's expand this sample a bit:

```jsx
const Todos = () => (
  <Fragment>
    <h1>Todos</h1>
    <ul></ul>
    <button></button>
  </Fragment>
)

const Persons = () => (
  <Fragment>
    <h1>People</h1>
    <ul></ul>
    <button></button>
  </Fragment>
)

const App = () => (
  <main>
    <Persons />
    <Todos />
  </main>
)
```

Which would result in

```
VDOM:
<App>
  <main>
    <Fragment>
      <h1>People</h1>
      <ul></ul>
      <button></button>
    <Fragment>
      <h1>Todos</h1>
      <ul></ul>
      <button></button>

DOM:
<main>
  <h1>People</h1>
  <ul></ul>
  <button></button>
  <h1>Todos</h1>
  <ul></ul>
  <button></button>
</main>
```

When we'd switch `<Todos />` to live in front of `<Persons />` we'd have to move all
three of its Dom-nodes in front of the first DOM-node wrapped with this `Fragment`
so we'd have to perform `insertBefore(x, <h1>People</h1>)` three times. This however
means that we have to store the `firstDomChild` of this `Fragment` to effectively
perform this operation.

That still sounds quite... convenient, doesn't it? Well this nesting could be any number,
think about the amount of `Context` wrappers or components that just fetch data until
you reach your first DOM-node? In most applications this isn't trivial, and there
are many more operations we have to consider, this is mainly a `moveBefore`
while there are many more operations to consider here.

The move from `<Todos />` before `<Persons />` could have been accompanied by a different
state change that results in us returning `null` from `<Todos />` which means we'd have to
unmount all of that DOM so the most efficient course of action here is to not
perform the three insertions at all and just unmount all of the DOM-nodes.

Linearly if we're moving something between two components we have to discover where the first component
ends and the next begins, this means that we'd need to look through their existing children and find out
which is the last DOM-child, however, as we have discussed earlier some of those children could be null,
some could be fragments and some could be DOM-nodes. Exploring these deeply for each and every operation
would be quite expensive, luckily for a lot of these operation we can keep our `firstDomChild` heuristic
where we'd look at the first DOM-node of the component that will come after the node we are inserting and
perform an `insertBefore`.

Now you know why we store `_nextDom` and have namings like `firstChildDom` in our
[`diffChildren`](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/10.24.0/src/diff/children.js#L118) algorithm.

All of these are small insights into what Preact, React, Vue and many others are abstracting away
from you, the declarative way of writing web-applications comes with a cost and a lot of hidden complexity.
Knowing all of these isn't needed when you are writing your web-applications but I do think that it
builds some empathy for the people who actively work on this.

I have been exploring optimisations to the Preact diffing algortihm for quite a while, I've been a maintainer
on the project now for 5'ish years (since 2019). In our v11 explorations we settled on a new diffing algorithm
for Preact-children, which we refer to as skew-based diffing, this has since 10.16.0 been backported to Preact.
In the future I'd love to write about everything we've discovered there but I wanted to collect my thoughts
about Fragments first.
